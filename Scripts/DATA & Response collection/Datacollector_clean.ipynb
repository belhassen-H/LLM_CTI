launched a phishing campaign targeting government and private sector organizations in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The attack begins with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Microsoft Office document exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability, which leads to the execution of a malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro. The macro downloads a payload from a remote server using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) command-line tool, and then injects the malware into a legitimate process using the Windows API call 'CreateProcess'. The malware, a variant of the 'Chinoxy' backdoor, establishes communication with the command and control (C2) server using Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) and encrypts the data using RC4. The C2 servers were identified to be part of a larger network of domains registered between February 2022 and April 2022. The attack campaign was observed between March 2022 and May 2022. The TA428 group is known for its use of spear-phishing and exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain initial access to victims' systems.\",\n","\"group name\": \"TA428\"\n","}\n","```\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["list = [\n","\"https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/2024-php-exploit-cve-one-day-after-disclosure\",\n","\"https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-new-macos-malware/111290/\",\n","\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/10/18/multiple-north-korean-threat-actors-exploiting-the-teamcity-cve-2023-42793-vulnerability/\",\n","\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/04/22/analyzing-forest-blizzards-custom-post-compromise-tool-for-exploiting-cve-2022-38028-to-obtain-credentials/\",\n","\"https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2024/pdf/JSAC2024_1_9_takeda_furukawa_en.pdf\",\n","\"https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2023-CTI-009.pdf\",\n","\"https://securityintelligence.com/x-force/trickbot-conti-crypters-where-are-they-now/\",\n","\"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/fin11\",\n","\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/talos-ir-q2-2023-quarterly-recap/\",\n","\"https://www.0ffset.net/reverse-engineering/malware-analysis/molerats-string-decryption/\",\n","\"https://www.embeeresearch.io/practical-queries-for-malware-infrastructure-part-3/\",\n","\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/palestinian-hackers-using-new.html\",\n","\"https://archive.is/LJFEF\",\n","\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1209.pdf\",\n","\"https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2024/pdf/JSAC2024_1_7_hara_nakajima_kawakami_en.pdf\"\n","         ]"],"metadata":{"id":"V_NzIY6M_Ta8"},"id":"V_NzIY6M_Ta8","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["urls = [\n","    #
