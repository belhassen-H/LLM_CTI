      "Lazarus  :  Because the [PLACEHOLDER] threat group has been active since a long time ago, there are many attack cases and various malware strains are used in each case. In particular, there is also a wide variety of backdoors used for controlling the infected system after initial access. AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) is continuously tracking and analyzing attacks by the [PLACEHOLDER] group, and in this post, we will analyze Volgmer and Scout, the two major malware strains used in their attacks. Volgmer is a backdoor that has been used by the [PLACEHOLDER] threat group since 2014. Volgmer, which usually runs by being registered as a service, is installed with a name that disguises it as a legitimate file. It differs from other malware in the fact that it encrypts and saves the configuration data in the registry key “HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Security”. ASEC identified that since 2014, Volgmer underwent many changes and has been used in attacks until about 2021. We also confirmed that since 2022, a downloader named Scout has been used in attacks instead of Volgmer. The basic operating mechanism of Scout is similar to the previous one, with the only difference in the actual features. The payload it downloads is presumed to be a backdoor for controlling the infected system.\n",
      "Because Volgmer is a DLL-type backdoor, it needs malware that installs it. A dropper was identified alongside the initial version of Volgmer, and this dropper installs Volgmer by creating a password-protected compressed version in the resource area before registering it as a service. The dropper also checks the number of arguments, recognizes Korean operating environments, and even checks the version of Windows operating environments, and if these do not match pre-configured conditions, it either displays a message box or deletes itself. A batch file is used for self-deletion, and the use of the file name “pdm.bat” is notable.\n",
      "The encrypted configuration data is decrypted during execution. This contains the registry key which will include the configuration data with the C&C server addresses, the string used to register the malware as a service, and the file “pdm.bate” to be used for self-deletion. The 0x10 byte-sized key used for decryption is still used by the malware from the Andariel group, a subsidiary group of [PLACEHOLDER]. [11]\n",
      "Key: 74 61 51 04 77 32 54 45 89 95 12 52 12 02 32 73\n",
      "One of the characteristics of Volgmer is that it follows a certain logic to randomly generate strings for the name of the Volgmer DLL file to be created, as well as the name and description of the service to be registered. These strings are created by combining the following strings contained in the decrypted configuration data.\n",
      "String A: svc, mgmt, mgr, enum, app, bg, c, d, ex, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, net, o, p, q, rm, sec, ti, up, vol, win, dc, ud\n",
      "String B: Service, Management, Manager, Enumerator, Application, Background, Control, Desktop, Extension, Function, Group, Host, Intelligent, Key, Layer, Multimedia, Network, Operation, Portable, Quality, Remote, Security, TCP/IP, User Profile, Volume, Windows, Device, Update\n",
      "For example, the file name is a combination of four selections from the “String A” list, resulting in names such as “hlrmenum.dll”. Likewise, service-related items are created by combining four selections from the “String B” list, as follows.\n",
      "Service name: “[Host Layer Remote Enumerator]”\n",
      "Service description: “The [Host Layer Remote Enumerator] is an essential service for management of Windows System. If the service is stopped or disabled, Windows will be able to damaged seriously.”\n",
      "Service DLL path: “C:\\Windows\\system32{hlrmenum}.dll”\n",
      "The Volgmer dropper decompresses “MYRES” in the resource area to obtain the Volgmer DLL and configuration files. These files are compressed with the ZIP compression algorithm and password-protected with the following password.\n"

      "Polonium  :  The attack, attributed to the [PLACEHOLDER] group, involved a multi-stage campaign targeting Israeli organizations. The initial vector was a phishing email containing a malicious Excel document, which exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability to deliver a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) payload. The RAT, identified as 'Nemerode', provided the attackers with remote access to the compromised system, allowing them to steal sensitive information and move laterally within the network. The attackers used various techniques to evade detection, including code obfuscation, anti-forensic tools, and time-based execution. The campaign involved the use of multiple C2 servers, with domains and IP addresses rotating every 10-15 minutes to evade detection. The attackers also used DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 servers. The attack was characterized by the use of multiple techniques, including Phishing (T1566), Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190), Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059), Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel (T1041), and Network Interface Discovery (T1016).\n"

      "\n",
      "1. The report mentions a malware strain named Volgmer, which has been used by the threat group since 2014. This is consistent with Lazarus Group's history of using various malware strains, including backdoors, droppers, and other types of malware.\n",
      "2. The report highlights the encryption of configuration data in the registry key \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Security\", which is a technique commonly used by Lazarus Group.\n",
      "3. The use of a dropper to install Volgmer is also consistent with Lazarus Group's tactics, as they have been known to use droppers to deploy their malware.\n",
      "4. The 0x10 byte-sized key used for decryption, which is shared with the Andariel group, a subsidiary group of Lazarus Group, further supports this attribution.\n",
      "5. The random generation of strings for the name of the Volgmer DLL file and the name and description of the service to be registered is a technique often used by Lazarus Group to evade detection and make their malware more difficult to identify.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe that the incident is likely attributed to the Lazarus Group.\n"

      "Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe that the incident is attributed to the APT39 group, also known as Chafer. Here's my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Targeted campaign**: The attack targeted Israeli organizations, which is consistent with APT39's known targeting of Israel and other Middle Eastern countries.\n",
      "2. **Initial vector**: The use of a phishing email containing a malicious Excel document is a common tactic employed by APT39, particularly in their earlier campaigns.\n",
      "3. **CVE-2021-40444 exploitation**: This vulnerability was exploited in several 2021 APT39 campaigns, including the ones targeting the telecommunications sector in the Middle East.\n",
      "4. **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**: The use of a RAT to provide remote access to the compromised system is a characteristic of APT39's tactics.\n",
      "5. **Code obfuscation, anti-forensic tools, and time-based execution**: These techniques are all part of APT39's arsenal to evade detection and avoid being discovered.\n",
      "6. **Multi-C2 servers with rapid domain/IP rotation**: APT39 has been known to use multiple C2 servers, often with rapid domain/IP rotation, to evade detection and maintain persistence.\n",
      "7. **DNS tunneling**: This technique is consistent with APT39's use of DNS tunneling in their campaigns.\n",
      "8. **Targeted attack tactics**: The attack's TTPs, including phishing, exploiting a public-facing application, command and scripting, exfiltration over C2, and network interface discovery, are all indicative of a targeted attack campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "APT39 has been actively involved in sophisticated cyber-attacks in the Middle East and has used similar tactics and techniques in their past campaigns. Given the similarities between these TTPs and those attributed to APT39, I believe that this threat group is responsible for the incident described in the report.\n"
