The initial vector was a phishing email containing a malicious Excel document, which exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability to deliver a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) payload. The RAT, identified as 'Nemerode', provided the attackers with remote access to the compromised system, allowing them to steal sensitive information and move laterally within the network. The attackers used various techniques to evade detection, including code obfuscation, anti-forensic tools, and time-based execution. The campaign involved the use of multiple C2 servers, with domains and IP addresses rotating every 10-15 minutes to evade detection. The attackers also used DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 servers. The attack was characterized by the use of multiple techniques, including Phishing (T1566), Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190), Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059), Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel (T1041), and Network Interface Discovery (T1016).",

The attack commenced with spear phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office documents, exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to deliver the Spoolsv.exe payload. The payload was then used to download and execute a malicious EXE file, which leveraged the DLL hijacking technique to inject malicious code into the legitimate svchost.exe process. The injected code enabled the attackers to establish persistence on the compromised machine, allowing them to exfiltrate data and communicate with the command and control (C2) server. The attackers utilized a combination of techniques to evade detection, including code obfuscation, anti-debugging, and encrypted communication with the C2 server. Furthermore, the attackers leveraged multiple C2 servers, with domains generated using the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) technique, making it challenging to track and block the malicious activity. The attack fingerprint dates back to at least 2020, with the latest activity observed in 2021.",

The attack vector began with a phishing email containing a malicious Microsoft Office document, which when opened, would execute a malicious macro. The macro would download and execute a VBScript from a remote server, which in turn would fetch and execute the Tiny Backdoor payload from another remote server. The Tiny Backdoor is a lightweight backdoor that provides remote access to the compromised system, allowing the attackers to upload/download files, execute commands, and perform other malicious activities. Notably, the attackers used MSBuild, a legitimate .NET build tool, to compile and execute the Tiny Backdoor payload, effectively evading detection by security software. The MSBuild executable was signed with a legitimate certificate, making it more challenging to identify the malicious activity. The attack was carried out between May 2022 and July 2022, with the malicious documents and scripts being hosted on servers located in the United States and Germany.",

The wrapper, dubbed Pelmeni, uses a combination of living off the land binaries (LOLBins) and fileless malware to evade detection. The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Microsoft Office document that exploits the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability to download a malicious payload. The payload is a legitimate Windows utility, mshta.exe, which is used to download and execute a malicious JavaScript code from a remote server. The JavaScript code then downloads and executes the Pelmeni wrapper, which in turn downloads and executes the Kazuar backdoor. The Kazuar backdoor is a custom-built modular backdoor that allows the attackers to steal sensitive information and carry out lateral movement within the network. The attack is characterized by its use of anti-forensic techniques, such as deleting system logs and hiding malicious files in legitimate system directories. The attack is attributed to the Turla group based on similarities with previous attacks and the use of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
