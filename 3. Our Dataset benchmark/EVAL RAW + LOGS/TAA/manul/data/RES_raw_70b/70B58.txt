Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe the threat actor responsible for the incident is Conti. Here's my reasoning:

1. **TTP overlap**: Conti is known to use a combination of techniques, including vulnerability exploitation, RDP brute-forcing, and phishing to gain initial access, which aligns with the report.
2. **Cobalt Strike and PsExec usage**: Conti has been observed using Cobalt Strike for command and control and PsExec for lateral movement, consistent with the report.
3. **Mimikatz usage**: Conti is known to use Mimikatz to harvest credentials, which is mentioned in the report.
4. **Ransomware delivery via phishing email**: Conti has been known to deliver ransomware payloads via phishing emails with malicious attachments, such as Excel documents with macros, which matches the report.
5. **AES-256 encryption and Bitcoin payment demands**: Conti ransomware typically uses AES-256 encryption and demands payment in Bitcoin, consistent with the report.
6. **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**: The report mentions several MITRE ATT&CK techniques, including T1190, T1472, T1489, T1059, T1210, T1558, T1562, and T1572, which are all associated with Conti's TTPs.
7. **Ransomware executable and phishing email subject lines**: While the 'lockfile.exe' executable and phishing email subject lines 'Payment Advice' and 'Invoice for recent order' are not unique to Conti, they do not contradict Conti's known TTPs.

Considering these overlaps, I believe Conti is the most likely threat actor responsible for the incident.
