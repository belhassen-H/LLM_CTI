Based on the TTPs described in the report, I believe the incident can be attributed to the MuddyWater threat actor group. Here's my reasoning:

1. The use of a phishing email with a malicious Excel document exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444) to deliver a RAT payload is a common tactic used by MuddyWater.
2. The use of the Nemerode RAT is also consistent with MuddyWater's known toolset. Nemerode has been previously associated with MuddyWater campaigns.
3. The use of code obfuscation, anti-forensic tools, and time-based execution to evade detection are all techniques commonly employed by MuddyWater to evade detection and stay under the radar.
4. The rotation of C2 servers every 10-15 minutes and the use of DNS tunneling to communicate with C2 servers are also tactics that have been observed in previous MuddyWater campaigns.
5. The use of multiple techniques, including phishing, exploit public-facing application, command and scripting interpreter, exfiltration over command and control channel, and network interface discovery, is also consistent with MuddyWater's known modus operandi.

Taking all these factors into account, I believe that the incident can be attributed to the MuddyWater threat actor group.
