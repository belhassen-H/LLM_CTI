Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe the threat actor responsible for this cyber incident is the Gaza Cybergang, also known as the Molerats.

Here's why:

1. The report mentions that the attackers are an Arabic-language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012, primarily targeting the MENA region. This matches the profile of the Gaza Cybergang, a known group with a similar motivation and target scope.
2. The report highlights the use of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) like Downeks, Qasar, and Cobaltstrike, which are commonly associated with the Gaza Cybergang.
3. The technique of using Microsoft Office documents with embedded macros to deliver malware, as described in the report, is a known TTP of the Gaza Cybergang.
4. The report mentions the use of the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, which was previously associated with the Gaza Cybergang.
5. The social engineering lures and decoys described in the report, such as using political and humanitarian incidents to trick victims, are consistent with the Gaza Cybergang's tactics.
6. The report references a previous publication by Kaspersky Lab, which provides further evidence linking the Gaza Cybergang to this incident.

While the report replaces the threat actor's name with [PLACEHOLDER], the accumulated evidence points strongly to the Gaza Cybergang as the responsible party.
