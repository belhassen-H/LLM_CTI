Based on the technical analysis of the threat report, I believe the threat actor responsible for the DodgeBox loader and MoonWalk backdoor is APT41 (also known as Winnti or Barium). Here's my reasoning:

1. **DLL sideloading**: APT41 is known to use DLL sideloading as a method of executing malware, which matches the technique used by DodgeBox.
2. **Targeted regions**: The report mentions that DodgeBox samples were submitted from Thailand and Taiwan, which aligns with APT41's history of targeting Southeast Asian countries.
3. **Similarities to StealthVector**: The report highlights several similarities between DodgeBox and StealthVector, which is a tool associated with APT41. The similarities include checksum and configuration decryption, decrypted configuration format, environment keying, and disabling CFG.
4. **Code reuse and evolution**: The report suggests that the threat actor has reused and evolved code from previous campaigns, which is a common trait of APT41.

While the report's confidence level in attribution is medium, the cumulative evidence points strongly to APT41 as the responsible threat actor.
