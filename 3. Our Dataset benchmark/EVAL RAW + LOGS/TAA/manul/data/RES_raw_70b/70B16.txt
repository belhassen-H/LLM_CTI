Based on the analysis of the report, I believe the threat actor responsible for the incident is APT35 (also known as Cobalt Mirage, TunnelVision, and Charming Kitten).

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The report mentions the use of FoxShell, which is a known webshell used by APT35.
2. The threat actor's TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) described in the report, such as the use of open-source tools, reconnaissance, and RATs (Remote Access Trojans), are consistent with APT35's modus operandi.
3. The report mentions the use ofDarkBit (also known as DEV-1084), which is a subgroup of APT35, and has been linked to the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).
4. The report highlights the use of similar campaign names, such as "Lord Nemesis" and "IronSwords", which are similar to previous campaigns attributed to APT35.
5. The tactics described in the report, such as the use of fake hacktivist operations, targeted phishing emails, and exploitation of vulnerabilities, are consistent with APT35's tactics.
6. The mention of Iran and the reference to the "Swords of Iron War" against Hamas terrorists suggests that the threat actor is likely an Iranian-backed group, which is consistent with APT35's affiliation.

Based on these points, I believe that APT35 (Cobalt Mirage, TunnelVision, and Charming Kitten) is the most likely threat actor responsible for the incident described in the report.
