Based on the information provided, I believe the threat actor responsible is DarkHotel.

My reasoning is as follows:

* The report mentions that the threat actor is a sophisticated and active APT group, known for finding and taking advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in common software (0days).
* The group is known to be comprised of Korean-speakers and works on behalf of a nation-state.
* The report mentions the use of malware such as Asruex, Parastic Beast, Inexsmar, Retro backdoor, Gh0st RAT, and the Ramsay toolkit, which are all associated with DarkHotel.
* The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office, using .HTA files, and infecting hotel WiFi networks, are consistent with DarkHotel's known TTPs.
* The report mentions the use of spear-phishing emails with .RAR archives, which is a known tactic used by DarkHotel.
* The geographic focus of the attacks, including Asia, Europe, North America, and Africa, with a primary focus on North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and China, is consistent with DarkHotel's known areas of operation.
* The report mentions the use of 0day exploits, including CVE-2018-8174, CVE-2018-8373, CVE-2019-13720, CVE-2019-1458, and CVE-2020-0674, which are all associated with DarkHotel.
* The report also mentions the use of encryption, obfuscation, and singular attacks to avoid exposing stolen certificates or 0day vulnerabilities, which is consistent with DarkHotel's tactics.

Overall, the combination of these factors leads me to conclude that the threat actor responsible is DarkHotel.
