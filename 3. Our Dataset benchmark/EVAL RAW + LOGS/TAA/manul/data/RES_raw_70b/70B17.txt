Based on the analysis of the report, I believe that the threat actor responsible for this incident is MuddyWater, an Iranian-sponsored threat group. Here's my reasoning:

1. **TTPs match known MuddyWater activities**: The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report align with those previously attributed to MuddyWater. Specifically, the use of malicious Word documents with VBA macros, the deployment of a lightweight first-stage RAT, and the command and control (C2) communication patterns all match MuddyWater's modus operandi.
2. **Targeting of Middle Eastern countries**: The report indicates that the campaign has targeted countries in the Middle East, which is consistent with MuddyWater's known interest in the region. MuddyWater has been linked to the Iranian government and has targeted countries in the region, including Israel, Turkey, and others mentioned in the report.
3. **Use of country codes**: The use of country codes in the script, such as "PK" for Pakistan, "IL" for Israel, and "TR" for Turkey, is similar to MuddyWater's previous tactics. This suggests that the threat actor is interested in tracking and distinguishing between targets in different countries.
4. **Code obfuscation and simplicity**: The script's simplicity and the use of limited obfuscation are also consistent with MuddyWater's coding style, which often prioritizes functionality over stealth.
5. **Dynamic IP rotation and C2 communication**: The rotation of IP addresses and the use of HTTP GET and POST requests for C2 communication are techniques commonly employed by MuddyWater to evade detection and maintain persistence.

While the report mentions that the campaign might still be active, it does not provide any direct evidence linking the incident to MuddyWater. However, based on the TTPs and characteristics described, it is likely that MuddyWater is responsible for this incident.
