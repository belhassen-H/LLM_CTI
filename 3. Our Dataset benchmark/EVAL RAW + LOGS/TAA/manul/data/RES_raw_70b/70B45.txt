Based on the provided threat report, I attribute the incident to the threat actor group known as Platinum or Terminal. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and Adobe Flash**: The report mentions the use of specific CVEs (CVE-2012-1856, CVE-2015-1641, and CVE-2018-4878), which is consistent with Platinum's known modus operandi.

2. **Custom-made malware payloads and variants of XtremeRAT or PlugX**: This aligns with Platinum's attack framework, which is known to involve custom-made Trojans and malware payloads.

3. **Use of phishing emails or infected installers as initial infection vectors**: This matches Platinum's known tactics of using social engineering and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access.

4. **Use of legitimate tools such as PowerShell and Mimikatz for credential harvesting and lateral movement**: Platinum is known to leverage legitimate tools to achieve their objectives, which is a key aspect of their TTPs.

5. **Employment of 'fileless' malware**: The report mentions the use of "fileless" malware, which is a distinctive technique associated with Platinum. This technique allows the malware to reside only in memory, making it difficult to detect.

Given the consistency of these characteristics with Platinum's known TTPs and attack framework, I am confident that the incident described in the report can be attributed to this threat actor group.
