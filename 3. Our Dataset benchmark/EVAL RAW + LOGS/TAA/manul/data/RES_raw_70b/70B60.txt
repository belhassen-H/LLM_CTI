Based on the analysis of the threat report, I believe the incident can be attributed to the APT41 threat actor group. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Use of MSBuild for evasion**: APT41 is known to utilize MSBuild to evade detection. They have used this technique in previous campaigns to compile and execute malicious payloads, making it harder for security software to identify the malicious activity.
2. **Tiny Backdoor payload**: APT41 has been associated with the use of the Tiny Backdoor malware in previous attacks. The lightweight backdoor provides remote access to compromised systems, allowing attackers to conduct further malicious activities.
3. **Phishing email with malicious Office document**: APT41 often uses phishing emails with malicious Office documents to initiate their attacks. These documents typically contain malicious macros that download and execute additional payloads.
4. **Use of VBScript and remote servers**: APT41 has been observed using VBScript and remote servers to download and execute malware payloads. This technique is consistent with the attack vector described in the report.
5. **Geographic distribution of command and control (C2) servers**: APT41 is known to operate out of China, but they often use servers located in other countries, including the United States and Germany, to host their malicious infrastructure. This matches the geographic distribution of servers described in the report.
6. **Timeframe of the attack**: The attack timeline of May 2022 to July 2022 is consistent with APT41's known activity patterns. They often conduct campaigns during this timeframe, which coincides with the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.

While [PLACEHOLDER] was used to redact sensitive information, the combination of techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report strongly suggests that APT41 is the responsible threat actor group.
