Based on the analysis of the threat report, I attribute the incident to the APT31 threat actor group. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Chinese APT group**: The report mentions that the attack is attributed to a Chinese APT group, which aligns with APT31's known nationality.
2. **Spear-phishing with Microsoft Office document attachment**: APT31 is known to use spear-phishing emails with malicious Office document attachments to deliver their malware. This tactic is a common TTP for APT31.
3. **XOR-encoded executable and dropper malware**: APT31 has been observed using XOR-encoded executables and dropper malware to evade detection. This technique is consistent with their known modus operandi.
4. **Remote Access Tool (RAT) capability**: APT31 is known to use RATs with capabilities such as data exfiltration, command execution, and lateral movement, which matches the description in the report.
5. **Anti-forensic techniques**: APT31 has been observed using anti-forensic techniques such as code injection into legitimate processes, API hooking, and string encryption to evade detection, which aligns with the report's description.
6. **Living-off-the-land (LOTL) tactics**: APT31 is known to use LOTL tactics, leveraging legitimate system utilities and tools to carry out malicious activities, which is consistent with the report's description.
7. **Specific C2 communication protocol**: The use of a specific C2 communication protocol involving HTTP requests to a hardcoded C2 server with encoded data is reminiscent of APT31's known C2 protocols.
8. **User-Agent string and command**: The specific User-Agent string and command ('ping -n 1 172.217.23.166') used by the malware are similar to those observed in previous APT31 campaigns.
9. **Timeline**: The attack timeline between October 2020 and March 2021 is consistent with APT31's known activity periods.

While the report does not provide direct evidence linking the attack to APT31, the cumulative evidence from the TTPs, techniques, and tactics described suggests a strong likelihood that APT31 is responsible for this incident.
