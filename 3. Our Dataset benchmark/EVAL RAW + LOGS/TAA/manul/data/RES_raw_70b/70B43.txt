Based on the analysis of the threat report, I believe the incident can be attributed to the Lazarus Group, a known Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor associated with North Korea.

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Use of phishing email with a malicious Microsoft Office document**: Lazarus Group has been known to use phishing emails with malicious attachments to target victims. In this case, the use of a CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability in Equation Editor to deliver the payload is a tactic commonly associated with Lazarus Group.
2. **Multi-stage malware campaign with droppers and backdoors**: Lazarus Group is known for its complex, multi-stage malware campaigns, often involving droppers and backdoors to establish persistence on victim machines.
3. **Use of code obfuscation, anti-debugging, and encryption**: Lazarus Group is known for using advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection, including code obfuscation, anti-debugging, and encryption.
4. **Use of legitimate services as C2 servers**: Lazarus Group has been known to use legitimate services, such as cloud providers, as C2 servers to make detection more difficult. In this case, the use of VMware Cloud as a C2 server is a tactic commonly associated with Lazarus Group.
5. **Financial motivation and targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges**: Lazarus Group has been associated with numerous financially motivated cyber attacks, including targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and organizations involved in cryptocurrency trading.

The mention of "AppleJeus" as the backdoor name is also a strong indicator, as AppleJeus is a known malware variant associated with Lazarus Group.

Based on these similarities in TTPs and motivations, I believe the incident described in the report is likely attributed to the Lazarus Group.
