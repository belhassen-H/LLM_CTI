Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe the incident can be attributed to the threat actor group known as "Operation DustySky" or "PLATINUM".

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The use of "Air-Gap Jumping" and the creation of a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot to transmit stolen data to a command and control server is a unique TTP that has been previously associated with PLATINUM.
2. The use of social engineering to trick victims into inserting infected USB drives into air-gapped machines is also a known tactic used by PLATINUM.
3. The custom-built implant used in the attack, which employed techniques such as code injection, API hooking, and anti-debugging to evade detection, is similar to malware used in previous PLATINUM operations.
4. The timeline of the attack, between 2018 and 2020, aligns with known PLATINUM activity during that period.

PLATINUM is a known Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, believed to be of Chinese origin, which has been responsible for several high-profile attacks on governments, industries, and organizations worldwide. Their capabilities and TTPs, as described in the report, match the known profile of PLATINUM.

While the report does not provide explicit evidence of PLATINUM's involvement, the combination of unique TTPs and the custom-built implant's characteristics point strongly towards their responsibility for the incident.
