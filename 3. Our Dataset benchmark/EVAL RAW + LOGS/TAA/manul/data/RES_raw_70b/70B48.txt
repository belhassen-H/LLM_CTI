Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe the incident can be attributed to APT 12, also known as Operation Luckycat or PLA Unit 91398.

Here's my reasoning:

1. Geopolitical context: The targeting of Tibetan activists, Indian and Japanese governments, and the use of malicious attachments exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office are consistent with previous APT 12 campaigns.
2. Exploitation of CVE-2010-3333: This vulnerability was previously exploited by APT 12 in other campaigns, such as Operation Ababil in 2012.
3. Use of steganography: APT 12 has been known to use steganography to exfiltrate data in previous attacks.
4. Infrastructure and C2 techniques: The use of compromised websites and servers as C2 servers, as well as fast-flux DNS, are common techniques employed by APT 12 to hide their infrastructure.
5. Malware capabilities: The malware's ability to gather system information, steal files, and inject keyboard and mouse events to control the compromised system remotely is consistent with APT 12's malware capabilities.
6. Anti-debugging and code obfuscation: These techniques are also commonly used by APT 12 to evade detection.
7. Timeline: The campaign's active period from 2011 to 2012, with a peak in March 2012, matches the timeline of previous APT 12 campaigns.

Overall, the combination of these TTPs and the geopolitical context strongly suggests that APT 12 is responsible for the LuckyCat attack.
