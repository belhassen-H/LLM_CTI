Based on the provided report, I believe the threat actor responsible for the WhiteBear incident is the Turla group. Here's why:

1. **Infrastructure overlap**: The report mentions that WhiteBear infrastructure has overlap with other Turla campaigns, such as those deploying Kopiluwak. This suggests a connection between the two.
2. **Similar TTPs**: WhiteBear uses compromised websites and hijacked satellite connections for C2 infrastructure, which is a known Turla tactic.
3. **Code signing certificate**: The use of a code signing certificate issued to "Solid Loop Ltd" is reminiscent of Turla's known tactics of using fictional corporations or assumed identities to obtain digital certificates.
4. **C2 servers**: The report mentions that WhiteBear C2 servers are consistent with long-standing Turla infrastructure management practices, including the use of compromised servers and hijacked destination satellite IP hosts.
5. **Targeting**: The target set of WhiteBear, including government foreign affairs, international organizations, and defense organizations, aligns with Turla's typical targeting profile.
6. **Technical details**: The report highlights unique technical details, such as the use of RSA+bzip2 compression and 3DES encryption, which are similar to those seen in Sofacy and Duqu2 components, also attributed to Turla.

While the report notes that WhiteBear infections are relatively rare and represent a departure from the broader Skipper Turla target set, the cumulative evidence points to Turla as the most likely threat actor responsible for the WhiteBear incident.
