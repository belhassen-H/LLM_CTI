Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe the incident can be attributed to the APT36 threat actor group.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. **Geopolitical connection**: The report mentions that the threat actor group is believed to be of Pakistani origin, which aligns with APT36's known origin and targeting preferences. APT36 is a Pakistan-based threat actor group that has been known to target entities in the region.
2. **Use of Android malware**: APT36 has a history of using Android malware in their campaigns, and SpyNote is a known malware strain that has been used by this group in the past.
3. **Phishing attacks**: Phishing is a common tactic used by APT36 to distribute malware, which aligns with the report's description of phishing attacks used to spread the malware.
4. **Use of DGA**: APT36 has been known to use DGA in their malware communications, making it difficult for security researchers to track and block their C2 servers.
5. **Timing and targeting**: The campaign's timing (June 2020 to August 2020) and targeting of countries like the United States, India, and Pakistan also align with APT36's known activities and interests.

While the report replaces the threat actor group's name with [PLACEHOLDER], the combination of TTPs, targeting preferences, and geopolitical connections described in the report point to APT36 as the likely threat actor responsible for the incident.
