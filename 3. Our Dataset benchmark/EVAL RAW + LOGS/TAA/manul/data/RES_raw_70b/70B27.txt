Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe the threat actor responsible for the incident is the Lazarus Group. Here's my reasoning:

1. Connection to North Korea: The report mentions that the [PLACEHOLDER] group is deemed supported by North Korea, which is a known characteristic of the Lazarus Group.
2. Historical attack patterns: The report mentions that the group has been active since 2013, initially targeting North Korea-related research institutes in South Korea, and then expanding to other countries since 2017. This matches the known attack patterns of the Lazarus Group.
3. Use of social engineering attacks: The report mentions that the group typically uses social engineering attacks like spear phishing, which is a common TTP of the Lazarus Group.
4. Use of Meterpreter: The report highlights the use of Meterpreter, a backdoor malware, which is a tool commonly used by the Lazarus Group in their attacks.
5. Development of proxy malware in GoLang: The report mentions that the proxy malware used in this attack is developed in GoLang, which is a recent trend observed in Lazarus Group's operations.
6. Use of similar C&C addresses: The report mentions that the C&C address used in the attack had been used by the [PLACEHOLDER] group in the past, which suggests a connection to the Lazarus Group.
7. Similarity in attack methods: The report mentions that the method of having the regsvr32.exe process running the malware is the same as the method used by the [PLACEHOLDER] group in the past, which is a known TTP of the Lazarus Group.

While the report does not provide direct evidence of the threat actor's identity, the cumulative weight of these indicators points strongly towards the Lazarus Group as the responsible party.
