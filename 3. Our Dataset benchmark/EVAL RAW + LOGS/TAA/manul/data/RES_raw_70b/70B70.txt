Based on the TTPs and techniques described in the report, I believe the attack can be attributed to the threat actor group known as APT41.

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Initial Access via Phishing and Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882**: APT41 has been known to use phishing emails as an initial attack vector, and exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-11882, is a common tactic for them.
2. **Use of Cobalt Strike Beacon**: APT41 is known to use Cobalt Strike in their operations, and the use of a beacon for reconnaissance and post-exploitation activities aligns with their TTPs.
3. **Lateral Movement via RDP and Abuse of Legitimate Tools**: APT41 has been observed using RDP for lateral movement in previous campaigns. Additionally, their use of legitimate tools like ProcDump to evade detection is consistent with their tactics.
4. **Use of mshta.exe and Fileless Malware**: APT41 has been known to use mshta.exe to execute scripts and create backdoors, as well as employ fileless malware techniques to maintain persistence on compromised systems.
5. **Timeline**: The attack timeline, dating back to October 2020, with AnXun VPN exploitation observed from November 2020 to April 2021, aligns with APT41's known activity during that period.

While the report doesn't provide direct evidence of the threat actor's identity, the combination of these TTPs and techniques strongly points to APT41 as the likely perpetrator.
