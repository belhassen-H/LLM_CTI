Based on the report, I believe the [PLACEHOLDER] group is responsible for the incident. Here's my reasoning:

1. The report mentions a supply chain attack, which is a common tactic used by the [PLACEHOLDER] group. In the past, they have targeted software updates and compromise legitimate software update mechanisms to distribute malware.
2. The use of Typosquatting is a unique technique often associated with the [PLACEHOLDER] group. They have been known to use this technique to register domain names that are similar to legitimate domains, making it difficult for users to detect the difference.
3. The malware payload used in this attack, a variant of TrickBot, is also consistent with the [PLACEHOLDER] group's tactics. TrickBot is a widely used banking trojan, and the group has been known to use it in previous campaigns.

Given these similarities, it is likely that the [PLACEHOLDER] group is responsible for the incident.
