Based on the provided threat report, I believe the threat actor responsible for the incidents is the Russian nation-state threat actor known as Nobelium, Cozy Bear, and Midnight Blizzard. This conclusion is drawn from the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, which match those commonly associated with this group.

The report mentions the group's use of sophisticated malware attacks, including the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Exchange server software, as well as the use of password spray, API abuse, phishing, and token theft to gain credentials and privileged access to victims' systems. The group's ability to develop and maintain custom malware, such as FoggyWeb and MagicWeb, and its reliance on advanced techniques like DLL sideloading and HTML Smuggling, are also characteristic of Nobelium's activities.

The report also highlights the group's focus on targeting governments, defense entities, critical manufacturing organizations, and IT service providers, which is consistent with Nobelium's known targets. Furthermore, the report mentions the group's use of phishing emails with deceptive subjects and attachments, as well as its ability to reuse previously used tools and techniques, which is consistent with Nobelium's tactics.

The report's description of the group's activities in April 2023, targeting diplomatic and foreign ministries of NATO and EU member states, and the use of previously undocumented malware payloads, is also consistent with Nobelium's known activities. Overall, the TTPs and techniques described in the report match those commonly associated with Nobelium, leading me to conclude that this group is likely responsible for the incidents described in the report.
