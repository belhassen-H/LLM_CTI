Based on the TTPs described in the report, I attribute the incident to the [PLACEHOLDER] group. Here's my reasoning:

1. The use of MSBuild to evade detection is a common technique associated with the [PLACEHOLDER] group. They have been known to use legitimate tools and signing certificates to disguise their malicious activity.
2. The delivery vector via phishing email and malicious Microsoft Office document is a proven tactic used by the [PLACEHOLDER] group in the past.
3. The use of a Tiny Backdoor payload is consistent with the group's preferred method of maintaining persistence on compromised systems.
4. The remote execution of VBScript and the use of servers located in multiple countries are indicative of the group's ability to maintain a global network of infected systems.

However, it's worth noting that this attribution is based on my analysis of the provided information and might not be definitive.
