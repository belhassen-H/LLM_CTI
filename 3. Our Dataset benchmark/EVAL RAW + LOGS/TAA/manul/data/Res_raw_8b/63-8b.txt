Based on the provided threat report, I attribute the incident to APT37, also known as Starcruft, a North Korean state-sponsored threat actor. 

I believe this attribution to be accurate because the TTPs used in the attack match those commonly employed by APT37. The use of spear-phishing emails containing malicious Office documents, combined with the exploitation of a known vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882), are classic tactics often used by APT37. Additionally, the use of LOTL techniques, malicious Office documents, and exploit of known vulnerabilities reinforce the attribution.
