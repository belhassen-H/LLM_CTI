Based on the provided threat report, I attribute the incident to the North Korean state-sponsored threat actor group, Lazarus. My reasoning is as follows:

1. The report mentions that the threat actor group is known for its expertise in exploiting 0day vulnerabilities, which is a characteristic of the Lazarus group.
2. The report references the exploits CVE-2018-8174, CVE-2018-8373, CVE-2019-1458, and others, which are similar to the exploits used by Lazarus in previous campaigns.
3. The report mentions the use of CVE-2017-8570 and CVE-2017-11882, which are high-risk issues in Microsoft Office and are often exploited by Lazarus.
4. The report highlights the group's ability to leverage stolen certificates and deploy .HTA files to compromise hotel Wi-Fi networks, which is a tactic similar to that used by Lazarus in previous campaigns.
5. The report mentions the use of Gh0st RAT malware, which is also associated with Lazarus.
6. The report notes that the group has targeted a wide range of countries, including North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and China, which is consistent with Lazarus's known targeting profile.
7. The report's reference to the "Operation WizardOpium" campaign, which exploited a Chrome Browser vulnerability, and the use of a Windows privilege escalation 0day exploit (CVE-2019-1458), suggests a level of sophistication and resourcefulness similar to Lazarus's capabilities.
8. The report's mention of the Ramsay toolkit and its connection to Lazarus through code similarities and exploit patterns further supports the attribution to Lazarus.

While other threat actors may share some similarities with the described TTPs, the cumulative evidence points to Lazarus as the most likely responsible group.
