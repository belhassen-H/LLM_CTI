Based on the description of the cyber incident, I attribute the incident to the Platinum group, also known as Terminal, with high confidence. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and Adobe Flash**: Platinum is known to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and Adobe Flash to deliver custom-made malware payloads, which matches the incident report.
2. **Phishing emails or infected installers**: The initial exploitation vector via phishing emails or infected installers is consistent with Platinum's tactics.
3. **CVE-2012-1856, CVE-2015-1641, and CVE-2018-4878**: These specific vulnerabilities correspond to those mentioned in the report, and Platinum is known to exploit similar vulnerabilities.
4. **Custom-made Trojan or variant of XtremeRAT or PlugX malware**: The report describes the malware as a custom-made Trojan or a variant of XtremeRAT or PlugX, which matches Platinum's usual malware payloads.
5. **PowerShell and Mimikatz usage**: Platinum is known to use legitimate tools such as PowerShell and Mimikatz for credential harvesting and lateral movement, which is consistent with the report.
6. **Fileless malware**: Platinum's use of fileless malware, which resides only in memory and leaves no traces on disk, making it difficult to detect, is also consistent with the report.
7. **Timeline**: The timestamps associated with Platinum's activities, including June 2013, December 2014, May 2015, and August 2019, match the reported incident.

Given the strong correlation between the incident report and Platinum's known TTPs, I conclude that the Platinum group, also known as Terminal, is responsible for the cyber incident described.
