Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe that the threat actor responsible for this incident is the APT group, known as DarkHotel.

Here's a breakdown of the evidence that leads me to this conclusion:

1. The report mentions that the attack code and malware (TSCookie and Bifrose) are associated with [PLACEHOLDER], which is a known alias for DarkHotel.
2. The malware, Hipid, is designed to receive commands from a C2 server and execute arbitrary commands, which is a common behavior observed in DarkHotel's malware.
3. The use of host command to resolve host names and the presence of S-Box data used for encryption in some samples of the malware are also consistent with DarkHotel's techniques.
4. The discovery of the malware on the server used by the attacker, along with the presence of known DarkHotel malware (TSCookie and Bifrose), suggests a high level of confidence in attributing the incident to DarkHotel.
5. The report's mention of [PLACEHOLDER]'s recent activity exploiting vulnerabilities in externally accessible systems is also consistent with DarkHotel's modus operandi.

While direct references to DarkHotel have been replaced with [PLACEHOLDER], the details provided in the report strongly suggest that this group is responsible for the incident.
