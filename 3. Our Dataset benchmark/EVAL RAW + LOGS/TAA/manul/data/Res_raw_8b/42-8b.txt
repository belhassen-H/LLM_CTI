Based on the TTPs described in the report, I attribute the incident to the UNC2452 group. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Initial vector is a phishing email**: UNC2452 is known for using socially engineered attacks, including phishing emails and spear-phishing campaigns, to initiate their attacks.
2. **Exploitation of a known vulnerability**: UNC2452 has been observed exploiting various vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-11882, to deliver their malware payloads.
3. **Use of a modified open-source tool**: UNC2452 has been known to modify and use open-source tools, such as ScreenConnect, to facilitate reconnaissance and lateral movement.
4. **Employment of WMI**: UNC2452 has been observed using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute commands and gather system information, which is consistent with this report.
5. **DNS tunneling for C2**: UNC2452 has been known to use DNS tunneling to communicate with their C2 servers, using techniques like using the DnsClient API to send and receive data.
6. **Anti-forensic techniques**: UNC2452 is known for employing anti-forensic techniques, such as clearing event logs and disabling security software, to evade detection and cover their tracks.

The time frame of the attack (June-September 2022) also correlates with the UN2452's known activity during this period.

While the report doesn't explicitly mention the threat actor group, the described TTPs are consistent with the M.O. of UNC2452, a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor known for their advanced malware capabilities and tactics.
