Based on the TTPs described in the report, I believe the threat actor responsible for the incident is REvil (also known as Sodinokibi). Here's my reasoning:

1. Use of vulnerability exploitation, RDP brute-forcing, and phishing for initial access: REvil has been known to use these techniques in the past to gain access to victim networks.
2. Use of Cobalt Strike beacons for command and control: Cobalt Strike is a commercial post-exploitation framework commonly used by sophisticated threat actors, including REvil.
3. Use of PsExec for lateral movement: PsExec is a legitimate tool that can be used for lateral movement, and REvil has been observed using it in previous attacks.
4. Use of Mimikatz to harvest credentials: Mimikatz is a well-known credential harvesting tool, and REvil has been known to use it in its attacks.
5. Delivery of ransomware payload via phishing email with macro: REvil has been known to deliver its ransomware payload via phishing emails with macros in the past.
6. Use of AES-256 encryption: REvil's ransomware has been known to use AES-256 encryption in the past.
7. Demands for payment in Bitcoin: REvil has been known to demand payment in Bitcoin in the past.
8. Activity spike in mid-August: REvil has been known to be active during the summer months, and an activity spike in mid-August is consistent with their typical operating pattern.

The specific ransomware executable 'lockfile.exe' and phishing email subject lines 'Payment Advice' and 'Invoice for recent order' are also consistent with REvil's TTPs.

While the report does not specifically mention the [PLACEHOLDER] group, the TTPs and techniques described are highly consistent with those used by REvil. Therefore, I believe it is likely that REvil is responsible for the incident.
