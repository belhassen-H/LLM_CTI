Based on the report, I attribute the incident to the [PLACEHOLDER] group, which is a subgroup of the North Korean Lazarus Group. My reasoning is based on the following TTPs and information:

1. The malware family is written in PureBasic, a programming language that is rarely used in malware creation, which suggests a distinct signature that is consistent with North Korean threat actor activity.
2. The configured Command & Control server points to IP address 173.249.33[.]80, which is allocated to Contabo GmbH, a German mass-hosting provider. This suggests that the threat actors have compromised a web server in India, which is a common tactic used by North Korean threat actors.
3. The attackers' motive for targeting the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in India is likely driven by a desire to obtain sensitive information related to COVID-19 vaccine development, which is a major interest for North Korean threat actors.
4. The DPRK has a history of targeting Indian organizations, including space agencies, nuclear power plants, energy sectors, and medical research institutions, which suggests a broader-based victimology.
5. The report mentions that the COVID-19 pandemic has isolated North Korea further from the international community, and that the country continues to struggle with COVID-19 infections. This provides a strong motive for the threat actors to target the NIV, which is a leading health research center in India.
6. The malware's behavior, including its ability to download files, execute shell commands, and send back console output, is consistent with the TTPs of North Korean threat actors.
7. The report's mention of the Indian vaccine COVAXIN being of special interest to North Korea due to its ease of storage is also consistent with North Korean threat actors' interest in obtaining sensitive information related to COVID-19 vaccine development.

Overall, while the report does not provide direct evidence of the [PLACEHOLDER] group's involvement, the technical details and TTPs described are consistent with North Korean threat actor activity, and the motive for targeting the NIV in India is also consistent with these actors' interests.
