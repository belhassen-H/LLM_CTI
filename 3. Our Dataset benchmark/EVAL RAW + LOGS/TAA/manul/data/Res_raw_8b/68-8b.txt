Based on the TTPs described in the report, I attribute the [PLACEHOLDER] group's Zardoor backdoor attack to the APT34 (OilRig) threat actor group.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The attack involves a phishing email with a malicious Microsoft Office document exploiting a CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability, which is a common technique used by APT34.
2. The use of a compromised website to download the first-stage payload and a hardcoded C2 server to download the second-stage payload is consistent with APT34's methods.
3. The Zardoor backdoor's custom protocol and encryption using a hardcoded key are both characteristics of APT34's malware.
4. The malware's capabilities, such as executing commands, uploading and downloading files, and installing additional malware, are similar to those of APT34's earlier malware versions.
5. The use of anti-forensic techniques, such as deleting logs and disabling Windows Defender, is also consistent with APT34's tactics.
6. The combination of LOTL and fileless malware techniques to evade detection is a common approach used by APT34 to remain undetected.
7. The targeting of victims in the Middle East is also consistent with APT34's historical targeting patterns, as they have been known to target organizations and individuals in the region.

Overall, the TTPs described in the report, including the use of phishing emails, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and the use of custom malware with anti-forensic techniques, are consistent with APT34's modus operandi.
