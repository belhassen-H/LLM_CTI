Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I attribute the incident to North Korea's Lazarus Group (also known as APT38).

The report highlights several key indicators that point to Lazarus Group's involvement:

1. The use of tailored reconnaissance toolkit, specifically the RandomQuery malware, which is known to be used by Lazarus Group.
2. The distribution of the malware through CHM files, which is a tactic commonly employed by Lazarus Group.
3. The use of less common top-level domains (TLDs) such as .space, .asia, .click, and .online, which is a common practice for Lazarus Group's malicious infrastructure.
4. The phishing emails sent from a Daum email account, which is a typical tactic used by Lazarus Group.
5. The targeting of organizations and individuals related to North Korea, specifically human rights activists and defectors, which is a frequent target of Lazarus Group's operations.
6. The use of VBScript and Internet Explorer configurations, which is also consistent with Lazarus Group's TTPs.
7. The frequent exfiltration of system and hardware information, as well as the use of WMI classes to gather information, are also typical of Lazarus Group's reconnaissance operations.

Overall, the combination of these indicators strongly suggests that the incident was carried out by Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored APT group known for its targeted attacks and sophisticated tactics.
