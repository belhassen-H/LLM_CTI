Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I attribute the cyber incident to [PLACEHOLDER], a known APT group linked to the Russian intelligence service FSB. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Targeted attack**: The report mentions that the attack is targeted, which is consistent with [PLACEHOLDER]'s modus operandi of targeting organizations in former Soviet Union countries, including governments, research centers, and other sectors.
2. **Kazuar wrapper**: The use of Kazuar as part of the infection chain is a technique commonly employed by [PLACEHOLDER]. Kazuar is a highly customizable malware framework, and its use suggests a high degree of sophistication and customizability.
3. **Sideload DLL technique**: The report details the use of the Sideload DLL technique to hide the malware, which is a technique widely associated with [PLACEHOLDER]. This technique is used to load malicious DLLs into legitimate applications, making it difficult to detect.
4. **Complexity**: The malware's complexity, as described in the report, is reminiscent of [PLACEHOLDER]'s sophisticated TTPs. The use of custom algorithms, such as the Jenkins' one_at_a_time hashing algorithm, and the pseudorandom number generator (ranqd1) to decrypt function names and hash the computer name, suggests a high degree of sophistication.
5. **[N PLACEHOLDER]'s focus on collection of radio-electronic intelligence**: While not explicitly mentioned in the report, [PLACEHOLDER]'s focus on collecting radio-electronic intelligence is consistent with the report's discussion of intercepting, decrypting, and processing electronic messages.

Given the above factors, I believe that [PLACEHOLDER] is responsible for the cyber incident described in the report.
