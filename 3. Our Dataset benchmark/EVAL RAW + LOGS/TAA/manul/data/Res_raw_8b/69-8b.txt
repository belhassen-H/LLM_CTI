Based on the TTPs described in the report, I attribute the incident to the Chinese-based threat actor group '[PLACEHOLDER]' with high confidence. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Exploit of a Zero-Day vulnerability**: The report mentions the exploitation of a vulnerability in the Windows kernel (CVE-2018-0802), which suggests a high level of sophistication and expertise. This tactic is consistent with the activities of [PLACEHOLDER], known for their alleged close ties to the Chinese government and their ability to exploit complex vulnerabilities.
2. **Custom protocols and encryption**: The report highlights the use of a custom protocol over HTTP for C2 communication, which is encrypted using a custom algorithm. This level of customization and encryption is typical of [PLACEHOLDER]'s tactics, which often employ custom-made malware and communication protocols to evade detection.
3. **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)**: The use of a DGA to generate new domains for C2 communication is a technique commonly employed by [PLACEHOLDER] to avoid detection by tradional IP-based blocking techniques.
4. **'Living off the land' techniques**: The report mentions the malware's use of legitimate system administration tools and techniques to move laterally within the network, which is a hallmark of [PLACEHOLDER]'s tactics. This approach allows them to blend in with legitimate network traffic and evade detection.
5. **Non-standard certificate issuers and serial numbers**: The use of non-standard certificate issuers and serial numbers is a tactic often used by [PLACEHOLDER] to evade detection by monitoring tools and evade traditional certificate-based filtering.
6. **Encrypted commands**: The report mentions the use of encrypted commands to evade detection and monitoring tools, which is consistent with [PLACEHOLDER]'s typical tactics.

While it is not possible to confirm the exact attribution without additional information, the combination of these TTPs points towards [PLACEHOLDER] as the likely responsible party. The Chinese-based threat actor group is known for its sophisticated techniques, custom-made malware, and ability to evade detection, all of which are reflected in the report.
