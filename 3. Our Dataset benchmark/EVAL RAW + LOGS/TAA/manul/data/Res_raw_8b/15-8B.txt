Based on the information provided, I attribute the botnet takedown operation to a known threat actor group, which is [PLACEHOLDER]. The evidence for this attribution comes from the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, which are consistent with the TTPs used by [PLACEHOLDER].

Firstly, the report mentions that the operation targeted droppers, including IcedID, SystemBC, Pikabot, Smokeloader, and Bumblebee, which are all known to be used by [PLACEHOLDER]. These droppers are designed to install additional malware, such as ransomware, which is a hallmark of [PLACEHOLDER]'s activities.

Secondly, the report highlights the involvement of multiple countries and international organizations in the operation, which is consistent with [PLACEHOLDER]'s global reach and modus operandi.

Thirdly, the report mentions that one of the main suspects earned at least EUR 69 million in cryptocurrency by renting out criminal infrastructure sites to deploy ransomware, which is a common tactic used by [PLACEHOLDER].

Lastly, the report notes that the operation was coordinated from Europol's headquarters and involved multiple law enforcement agencies and private sector partners, which is consistent with [PLACEHOLDER]'s known relationships with these entities.

Based on these indicators, I am confident that [PLACEHOLDER] was responsible for the botnet takedown operation described in the report.
