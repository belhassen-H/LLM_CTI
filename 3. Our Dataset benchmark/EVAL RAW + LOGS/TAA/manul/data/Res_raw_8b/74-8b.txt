Based on the TTPs and information described in the report, I attribute the incident to the threat actor group tracked as "[PLACEHOLDER]", which is believed to be of Pakistani origin.

Here's my reasoning:

1. The use of SpyNote Android malware: SpyNote malware has been linked to Pakistani threat actors, specifically the "Pakistan-based threat actor group" by various sources, including Trend Micro and Symantec.
2. The combination of techniques used to spread the malware: The report mentions phishing attacks and downloading/installing malware-laden APK files, which are common tactics used by [PLACEHOLDER] in their operations. [PLACEHOLDER] has been known to use a range of attack vectors, including phishing, malvertising, and exploit kits, to infect victims with malware.
3. The use of Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to communicate with C2 servers: [PLACEHOLDER] has been known to use DGA to evade detection and make it difficult for security researchers to track and block their communication.
4. The resurgence in infections following the leak of the malware's source code: The report mentions that the malware saw a surge in infections in 2020, which is consistent with the leak of the malware's source code in 2016. This suggests that [PLACEHOLDER] took advantage of the leaked source code to update and improve their malware.
5. The submission of malware samples to VirusTotal from various countries: The report mentions that malware samples were submitted to VirusTotal from countries including the United States, India, and Pakistan. This suggests that [PLACEHOLDER] has a global reach and is targeting victims across multiple regions.
6. The attribution to a Pakistani origin threat actor group: The report mentions that the campaign is attributed to a threat actor group tracked as "[PLACEHOLDER]", which is believed to be of Pakistani origin. This matches the known affiliation of the threat actor group behind the SpyNote malware.

Based on these factors, I conclude that the incident is likely attributed to [PLACEHOLDER], a Pakistani origin threat actor group known for their use of SpyNote malware and other malicious activities.
