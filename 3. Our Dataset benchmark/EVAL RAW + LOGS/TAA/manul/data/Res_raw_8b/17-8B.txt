Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report, I believe that the [PLACEHOLDER] threat actor group, allegedly sponsored by the Iranian government and linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, is responsible for the cyber incident.

Here are the reasons why:

1. Geographical reach: The report mentions multiple countries in the Middle East and beyond as targets, which is consistent with [PLACEHOLDER]'s reported targeting of countries of interest to the Iranian government.
2. Methods: The use of compressed files wrapping malicious Word documents and VBA macros, as well as the use of obfuscated VBS scripts and HTTP GET/POST requests, are all consistent with [PLACEHOLDER]'s reported tactics.
3. Purpose: The report suggests that the purpose of the campaign is to maintain Iran's regional sovereignty, which is consistent with [PLACEHOLDER]'s alleged goals.
4. Signature: The report mentions specific behaviors, such as the use of country codes in the URI of the C2 contact and the output of system information, which are consistent with [PLACEHOLDER]'s reported TTPs.
5. Lack of functionality: The report notes that the script has "incomplete functionality" and suggests that the attackers may modify it later or use it to download and drop the next infection stage, which is consistent with [PLACEHOLDER]'s reported tactics of using initial stages as a foothold for further infection.

Overall, based on the similarities in TTPs and the context of the report, I believe that [PLACEHOLDER] is responsible for this cyber incident.
