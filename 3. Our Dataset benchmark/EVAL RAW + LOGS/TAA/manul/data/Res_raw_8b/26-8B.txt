Based on the report, I believe that the threat actor responsible for the malware is the [PLACEHOLDER] group. The reasons for this attribution are:

1. Similarities in code: The malware, named Troll Stealer, contains code similarities with the AppleSeed and AlphaSeed malware, which are attributed to the [PLACEHOLDER] group.
2. Use of Go language: The malware is written in Go, which is a language recently used by the [PLACEHOLDER] group.
3. Mutex usage: The malware uses mutexes, which are also used by the [PLACEHOLDER] group in their previous malware.
4. Hardcoded commands: The malware executes hardcoded commands to collect system information, which are identical to those used by AppleSeed malware.
5. Encryption and compression: The malware uses the same encryption and compression algorithms as those used by AlphaSeed.
6. C2 server communication: The malware communicates with the C2 server using the same protocol and structure as AlphaSeed.

Additionally, while there are some differences in the TTPs, such as the addition of new commands and the use of SOCKS5 proxy functionality in GoBear, it is possible that the [PLACEHOLDER] group may have shared the source code with another group or individual, which could have led to the creation of Troll Stealer and GoBear.

It is also noteworthy that the [PLACEHOLDER] group has been known to reuse code and techniques across multiple campaigns, so the similarities between Troll Stealer and AppleSeed/AlphaSeed are not surprising.

Overall, while there is no definitive proof that the [PLACEHOLDER] group is behind Troll Stealer and GoBear, the cumulative evidence points strongly towards attribution to this group.
