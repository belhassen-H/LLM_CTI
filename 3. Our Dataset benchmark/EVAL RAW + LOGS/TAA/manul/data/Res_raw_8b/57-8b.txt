Based on the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) described in the threat report, I attribute the PortDoor malware attack to the Chinese APT group, A41, also known as the Winnti Group. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Exploitation of a vulnerability in a Taiwanese software company's web application**: Winnti Group is known for targeting Asian organizations, particularly those in Taiwan and China, and exploiting vulnerabilities to deliver malware.
2. **Use of a custom protocol to communicate with the C2 server**: This is a typical technique used by A41 to communicate with their command and control servers, making it difficult to detect.
3. **TLS poisoning**: This is a technique commonly used by Chinese APT groups to disguise malicious traffic as legitimate TLS traffic, evading detection by security measures.
4. **Employment of anti-forensic techniques**: A41 is known for using anti-forensic techniques to evade detection, such as deleting system logs and modifying file timestamps.
5. **DLL hijacking**: This is a typical persistence technique used by Winnti Group to inject a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, allowing them to maintain persistence on the system.
6. **Espionage-oriented motives**: The attack's motives, targeting intellectual property and sensitive information, are consistent with the typical goals of A41, which is believed to be motivated by espionage and intellectual property theft.
7. **Geographic targeting**: The majority of victims being located in Taiwan is consistent with Winnti Group's typical targeting of Asian organizations, particularly Taiwan and China.

Overall, the combination of techniques, tactics, and procedures described in the report matches the modus operandi of the Winnti Group, attributing the PortDoor malware attack to this Chinese APT group.
